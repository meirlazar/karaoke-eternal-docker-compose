Note: I make no claim, warranty, or guarantee that any of this code will work, will always work, or won't slap your momma... it is untested (for now). Use at your own risk.

Credit: I also would like to give 100% of the credit for this project to bhj - https://github.com/bhj - https://github.com/bhj/KaraokeEternal for this amazing application.
